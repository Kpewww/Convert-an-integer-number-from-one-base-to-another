<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About This Code </h3>


- 🔭 &nbsp; I’m currently learning how to use git and github, and this is a test for uploading my program.
- 🤔 &nbsp; This program is one of my homework in Computer Organization & Machine-Dependent Programming course.
- 💼 &nbsp; As the title said, this program is for *converting an integer number from one base to another*. 
- This program would ask the user for the current base, the number in that current base, and the new base to be converted to.

<h3> How to run this program </h3>

1. use your terminal (or anything you can run C++ program) to open the current file.
2. type **make** into your ternimal and enter
3. enter the original base
4. enter the number of the original base
5. enter the new base that you want the number converts to

Then you will get your new number :wink:!

<h4> Note </h4>

+ A number in a base should between 2 and 36 (if you put it a larger number, I can't tell what will happen:innocent:)
+ Values from 10 - 35 will be represented by the letters A – Z
